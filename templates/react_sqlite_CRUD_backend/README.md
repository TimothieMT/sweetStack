# Fullstack React frontend which adds/edits/deletes items in backend SQLite CRUD API

This is the starting point for the simplest fullstack CRUD site that has a database. There is a React-frontend which allows the user to view, edit, delete and add flashcards, which are saved via a Node/Express-backend to an SQLite database (a `db.sqlite` file on the backend. The authentication is simply an admin password stored in an `.env` file in the backend. So there is only one user (admin) which logs in simply by typing a password on the frontend, and if correct, can edit/delete/add flashcard items. The UX is quite advanced: animated toaster notifications, forms allow Enter to save, forms appear with cursors focused in the first input field, and all access to backend will gracefully fail if there is a network error, e.g. if you stop the backend, the site will show a spinner for two seconds before displaying a message that the database is currently unavailable. All connection to the backend is done in useContext fo course. This is a good project if you want to build a fullstack application which has quite complete UX and frontend/backend communication, would be e.g. easy to swap out the SQLite database for MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB or even a Lowdb JSON file.
