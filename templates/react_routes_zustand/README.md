# React Site with Menu and Zustand

This is a simple one-page React site created with Vite that has Typescript and Sass installed, and with React Router and a CLI that enables you to easily create pages. It also has Zustand as centralized state management implemented with an example of loading both static and API data the Zustand state variables on two separate pages.

## features
