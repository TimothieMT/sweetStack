  "description": "This is the best book I've found which balances the teaching of critical thinking skills with real-world examples of conversations, and so explains informal logic not as a theoretical subject but as a set of conversational skills which contribute to clear expression and accurate meaning exchange between two people. For example, the author not only explains each fallacy, but gives examples of the best way to respond to real examples to it in a realistic conversation. If you want to learn critical thinking in a class form, I can recommend Cousera's [Think Again](https://www.coursera.org/course/thinkagain) course, which consists of dozens of both entertaining and informative video lectures as well as extensive interactive exercises.",

Today in our saturated social media and technological devices, I'm very interested in the topic of finding the right use and mix of technology in our lives, finding ways that not only allow us to not lose our humanity, but to enhance it, and I think this book is a good source of warnings of how technology and erode the human spirit.

  "description": "Since the 2016 presidential election made it apparent, absorbing the depth of dysfunctionality lodged in the American culture has become an intellectual project of millions of Americans. Who are these people who would elect, cheer, and support an obvious sexual predator, reality TV-show host, a man who doesn't read and who can't seem to talk above a 5th grade level? J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy at least seems to tell a story of an uneducated section of the American population from the first person, a section of the United States population that has made itself known with a loud, inaudible blurt. Regardless of the socio-economic class you come from in the United States, a feature of this book is it seems to allow us to see the hillbilly in the American culture as a whole, and the ways that this characteristic with its dumb loyalty and mockery of education is going to drag the United States further and further down to the bottom of the spectrum of a healthy and educated democracy.",

Flipping through it, I found the author selection well-chosen and the introductions to the authors insightful. And the dual language concept (English on the left side, French on the right side) is perfect for my French reading level, i.e. reading through some of the stories, I found that I had understood the French one way or didn't know a specific word, but after reading the English, found that it had a slightly different meaning and that the whole phrase made sense, e.g. \"Bianchon se promit de guetter Desplein\" is \"Bianchon made up his mind to watch Desplein\". The authors/stories contained in the book are: (1) Voltaire (1694-1778): Micromégas, (2) Honoré de Balzac (1799-1850): La Messe de l'Athée, (3) Gustave Flaubert (1821-1880): La Légende, de Saint Julien l'Hospitalier, (4) Charles Baudelaire (1821-1867): Le Spleen de Paris, (5) Guy de Maupassant (1850-1893): Menuet, (6) Paul Claudel (1868-1955): Mort de Judas, (7) André Gide (1869-1951): Le Retour de l'Enfant Prodigue, (8) François Mauriac (1885-1970): Grand-Lebrun, (9) Marce Aymé (1902-1967): Le Passe-Muraille, (10) Albert Camus (1913-1960): L'Hôte.",

He outlined a number of ideas on how to reconnect with and live out our spirituality, particularly for people who no longer take religious beliefs literally and for whom religious ritual and tradition has lost meaning. One idea that he had was to go on pilgrimages and to see trips such as vacations into pilgrimages where one goes to visit a place that one considers holy in some sense. Another idea was writing a letter to someone who was very influential in your life, based on studies that people who are grateful are more satisified and happier. While some of Sheldrake's other books seem a bit too metaphysical for my respect for objective science, what I want to get from this book are ideas on how to integrate spirituality in one's life regardless of the connection it has to science.",

There certainly are many positive reviews of this book, both as a factual book grounded in science as well as a playful book enabling us to draw our own conclusion on the difference between the sexes at a biological level: \"This is a great book to satisfy One's curiosity about the possible biological determinations that shape the relationship between men and women. I don't think his ideas were meant to be entirely factual, I think this is a brave theory that combines facts with playful speculations and opens the way for more exploration into the subject while daring others to complete, complement or even correct his perspective.\"",

Er vertritt eine Spielart des Daoismus, die mit den Lehren Epikurs zu vergleichen ist, der ebenfalls \"im Verborgenen lebte\", nicht politisierte und lachend philosophierte. Das Werk, das seinen Namen trägt, ist auch als »Das wahre Buch vom südlichen Blütenland« bekannt. Die hier versammelten Texte werden vom Herausgeber ausführlich kommentiert.",

Das Apollinische ist die gestaltende (klassische) Kraft der Harmonie und der schönen Künste.
